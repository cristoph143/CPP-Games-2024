Sudoku comes in various types and variations, each with its own unique rules or modifications. Here are some common types of Sudoku games:

### 1. **Classic Sudoku**
- **Standard Grid:** A 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as regions, boxes, or blocks).
- **Objective:** Fill the grid with digits from 1 to 9 so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains each digit exactly once.

### 2. **Mini Sudoku**
- **Standard Grid:** Smaller grids such as 4x4 or 6x6.
- **Objective:** Similar to classic Sudoku but with fewer cells and numbers, making it simpler and quicker.

### 3. **Samurai Sudoku**
- **Standard Grid:** Composed of five overlapping Sudoku grids arranged in a cross formation.
- **Objective:** Solve all five grids simultaneously. The overlapping regions share numbers across grids.

### 4. **Hyper Sudoku**
- **Standard Grid:** A 9x9 grid with four extra 3x3 regions (typically shaded) that also need to follow Sudoku rules.
- **Objective:** In addition to the usual rules, the shaded regions must also contain each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.

### 5. **Killer Sudoku**
- **Standard Grid:** A 9x9 grid with additional cages (groups of cells) that must sum to specific totals.
- **Objective:** Solve the grid such that the sum of numbers in each cage equals the given total while also following standard Sudoku rules.

### 6. **Jigsaw Sudoku (Irregular Sudoku)**
- **Standard Grid:** A 9x9 grid where the 3x3 subgrids are replaced with irregular shapes.
- **Objective:** Solve the grid with the same rules as classic Sudoku but with non-standard regions.

### 7. **Word Sudoku**
- **Standard Grid:** A Sudoku grid where letters or symbols replace numbers.
- **Objective:** Fill the grid so that each letter or symbol appears exactly once in each row, column, and subgrid.

### 8. **Diagonal Sudoku**
- **Standard Grid:** A 9x9 grid where two main diagonals also need to contain each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.
- **Objective:** Solve the grid with the additional constraint that both main diagonals adhere to Sudoku rules.

### 9. **Sudoku X**
- **Standard Grid:** A variation where both main diagonals must also contain each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.
- **Objective:** Solve the grid while satisfying Sudoku rules and the diagonal constraint.

### 10. **Sudoku Variants with Constraints**
- **Examples:** Variants include Sudoku with additional constraints such as specific cell restrictions or patterns, like arrows that indicate number sums.

### 11. **Multi-Sudoku**
- **Standard Grid:** Multiple Sudoku grids placed together with additional constraints or connections between them.
- **Objective:** Solve all grids simultaneously, with specific rules depending on the variation.

### 12. **Sudoku with Symmetry**
- **Standard Grid:** A 9x9 grid where the pattern of the filled cells exhibits symmetry (rotational or reflective).
- **Objective:** Solve the grid with the added challenge of maintaining a symmetrical pattern.

These variations provide different levels of difficulty and interesting twists on the classic Sudoku puzzle.
